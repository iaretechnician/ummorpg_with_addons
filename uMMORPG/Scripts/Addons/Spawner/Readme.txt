***1) in project ***
 - 1.1) import "2D Only Spawner" or "3D Only spawner" in addon
 - 1.2) (optional) create your copy prefab 

***1) add in scene :***
 - 1.1) add prefab in scene, click on it and parametrize it

****Advice :****
- 1) I advise you to create your own scriptables and not to use those present in the addons
- 2) I also advise you to create your own prefabs, this will avoid any subsequent overwriting

****Tips:****
  - copying a file on Unity is very simple, just press `Ctrl+d`
